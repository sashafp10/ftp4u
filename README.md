# ftp4u

I was always wanted to have a way of transferring my files from the phone to my PC within my home network. An obvious solution here is - FTP protocol. It was a great solution. While I was on Windows. But then my license had expired and I decided to move to Linux. I had found analogs for pretty much everything I needed. Except for FTP server. There is vsftp for sure. But I wanted to have UI and a way of monitoring who is doing what on the server in real-time.
So I've decided to build my own implementation of both client and server.
It should be:
  - free
  - cross-platform
  - with easy-to-understand UI
  - easy to extend
  - provide a way of diagnosing possible issues. Not somewhere in the logs deep deep in the system. But right there.

With all this AI stuff happening right now, I've decided to 1) utilize chatGPT or co-pilot as a team 2) spend not more than 1 hour for each commit.
It's curious to see how it'll go - creating a real-world product with me in a team-leader role and chatCPT in the role of my team :) .

Also I want to explore how dotNet is good without VS or Rider: only VS code and dotnet CLI (spoiler: worse than I've expected).
